ScanRenamer
===========

A quick prototype for a program to make my life easier.

For each folder (seperated by a newline) in the local file ```"folders.index"```,  
In which are there files in 2 formats:

1. {lesson}.{page}.jpg
2. .\*{number}.\* (a string containing a number)

Renames all the second format files (ordered by the number) to the first format,  
with the lesson = maximal lesson + 1.


**Note**: It's a quick prototype made in 2.5 hours.
