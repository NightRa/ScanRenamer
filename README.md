ScanRenamer
===========

A quick prototype for a program to make my life easier.  
It takes a folder, in which are there files in 2 formats:

1. {lesson}.{page}.jpg
2. Image ({number}).jpg

And then renames all the second format files,  
to the first format, with the maximal lesson + 1.

**Note**: It's a quick prototype made in 2.5 hours.  
Code might be ugly. Don't judge.
